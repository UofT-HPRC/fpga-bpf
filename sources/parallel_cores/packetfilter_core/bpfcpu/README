This is a pipelined soft CPU which implements the BPF instruction set. I 
implemented it in the usual datapath + controller paradigm:

I started by drawing up a schematic for the datapath based on the BPF spec. 
This left me with a couple dozen control bits (stuff like MUX selects, clock 
enables, etc.).

The job of the controller is to simply assert the right control bits on the 
right cycles. In order to pipeline the controller, I used this strategy:


 +------------+------------+------------+            +------------+
 |  Stage 0   |  Stage 1   |  Stage 2   |            |  Stage n   |
 |------------|------------|------------|            |------------|
 |            |            |            |            |            |
 |       +--+ |       +--+ |       +--+ |            |            |
 | ==+===|  |=====+===|  |=====+===|  |====  ....  ------+        |
 |   |   |> | |   |   |> | |   |   |> | |            |   |        |
 |   |   +--+ |   |   +--+ |   |   +--+ |            |   |        |
 |   |        |   |        |   |        |            |   |        |
 |   |        |   |        |   |        |            |   |        |
 +---|--------+---|--------+---|--------+-           +---|--------+
     |            |            |                         |
     v            v            v                         v

Basically, the first stage will decide the control signals for the entire 
instruction, and from that point on, each stage picks out the signals it uses 
and sends everything else to the next sstage (through a register).

Well, as they say, the devil is in the details, and my original implementation 
has a few issues. Don't get me wrong; it does work, and I did deal with all the 
hazards and stuff, but the code is not robust:

 -> Since it was the first time I had done a pipelined controller, there are a 
    lot of inconsistencies in the code (since I was learning as I went).

 -> The lack of any consistent handshaking schemes has made it very difficult 
    to modify the design to meet timing at high (> 300 MHz) frequencies.

 -> In general, it would not be easy to modify it for eBPF (but I guess there 
    currently is no "nice" way of editing CPU pipelines)

So this project will take the old code and clean it up. Hopefully I can 
increase the Fmax while I'm at it.
