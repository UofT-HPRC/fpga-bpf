The machine has two 32 bit registers, A (the accumulator) and X (used mostly for
addressing).

The "main memory" is the packet we are testing against. It is read-only. There 
is also a small, constant-sized scratch memory with read/write access. In the 
reference implementation, there are 16 words in the scratch memory.

There are eight classes of opcodes: 
 - LD:	Loading into the Accumulator
 - LDX:	Loading into the X register
 - ST:	Storing from the Accumulator
 - STX:	Storing from the X register
 - ALU:	Arithmetic & Logic
 - JMP:	Branching
 - RET:	Returning?
 - MISC:Other?

For LD instructions, you can use a Word (32 bits), half-word, or byte.
For LD instructions, there are the following addressing modes:
 - IMM: Use an immediate (specified in instruction)
 - ABS: Use absolute address (specified in instruction)
 - IND: Indirect (mem[X + value in instruction])
 - MEM: Instead of indexing into the packet itself, use scratch memory
	(address is always the immediate in the instruction)
 - LEN: Load the packet's length into a register
 - MSH: Some kind of weird shifting?

ST instructions only use scratch memory, and only support absolute addressing

For ALU instructions, the following operations are available:
 - ADD: A += X
 - SUB: A -= X
 - MUL: etc.
 - DIV: (integer division)
 - OR:  
 - AND: 
 - LSH: 
 - RSH: 
 - NEG: 
 - MOD: 
 - XOR: 

For JMP instructions, the following tests are available:

 - JA:   "Jump Always" (unconditional jump)
 - JEQ:  Jump if EQual
 - JGT:  Jump if Greater Than
 - JGE:  Jump if Greater than or Equal
 - JSET: Jump if A masked (i.e. ANDed) with a constant or X is nonzero
The instruction contains "jt" and "jf" fields, which say where to jump to. When
testing for equal, gt, or ge, you can specify it to test A (>|>=|=) constant
(where the constant is stored in the instruction), or A (>|>=|=) X. Note that 
this adds an offset to PC; it is not an absolute instruction index.

I'm not sure I understand RET instructions. I thought BPF programs were supposed
to return booleans? Anyway, you can either return A or a constant given in the
instruction.

There seem to only be two MISC instructions:
 - TAX: A = X
 - TXA: X = A
(just like in the 6502)

----------------------------

The instruction category is stored in the least-significant 3 bits (i.e. bits 2,
1, and 0).

If the instruction is LD or LDX, the size is in bits 4 and 3, and the addressing
type is in bits 7, 6, and 5. Where applicable, these are the same positions for 
the ST instructions.

If the instruction is an ALU instruction, the operation is in bits 7-4, and the
source for the second operand is in bit 3.

If the instruction is a JMP instruction, the type is in bits 6-4. The value to 
use for comparison (either an immediate or the X register) is indicated with bit
3.

For RET instructions, the value to return is specified by bits 4 and 3.

For MISC, the specific instruction is selected with bits 7-3. Right now, there 
is only 0x00 for TAX, and 0x80 for TXA.

---------------------------------------------------------------

In some sense, the types of packets that BPF is working on are "stateless". That
is, even if the state of your machine matters when dealing with TCP packets, 
figuring out whether or not a new packet is TCP doesn't depend on any previously 
received packets.

To put in different words, BPF is only designed to work on one packet at time 
while throwing away anything it discovered about the previous packet(s).

This may cause a few difficulties for me, since Galapagos kernels are typically
streaming, and may not feel the need to tack a header on everything.
